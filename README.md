## Overview

Created a basic notifications menu with some simple active states and JS interactivity.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Started with mobile design. Broke down the project into different components and mapped a basic HTML structure with React. Styled CSS using Tailwind then switched to the desktop design. Added active states before finishing with the JS.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Tailwind
- JS React
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned a lot about React and how their components worked with props. Learned a bit more about how destructuring works, but more research is needed.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I would like more practice with React and Tailwind, especially more complex React projects.
